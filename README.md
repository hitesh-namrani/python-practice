\# 🐍 Python Practice – First 10 Beginner Programs



Welcome to my Python learning journey!

This repository contains the \*\*first 10 beginner-level Python programs\*\* I wrote as I started learning Python in \*\*July 2025\*\*.



These programs cover the basics of input/output, conditions, calculations, and small logic building — all written from scratch for practice.
